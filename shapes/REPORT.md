# Report Grade - shapes

Report for Bargavi, for shapes project

## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles
  * Are you following TDD principles?
  * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
  * Did you iterate on your work?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor?
* Pass Rate
  * Did your code pass when I ran it?
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
* White box analysis
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer)?
* Miscellaneous Criteria
  * N/A

## Grades

### Following TDD principles
D

Initially solution is a bit too elegant. The original principles have not been adhered to
In some instances, a lesser amount of work was done, but still not enough to quantify (minimum)
Some iteration is evident, but not enough to warrant a strong grade

Further down the line, it looks as if you went into autopilot mode. As such the principles were not adhered to
at all so progressively the grade decreased from B->C->D

### Pass Rate
A

All code passes flawlessly. There is some superfluous code which can be deleted and not affect the pass mark.
I would suggest using a step-by-step analysis to improve redundancy for the future

### White box analysis
C

Primarily the code uses 1 or 2 elegant steps, such as identifying sorting that then reduces complexity.

However the code does not then improve on these iterations. It's as if you found one small item and then
stopped and didn't try find more small items. Especially in quadrilateral, where quite a lot of redundant
code is present.

### Miscellaneous Criteria
N/A - Not being used for this project

### Overall Grade
C

Not a bad first attempt. But the solution was primarily obtained backwards. i.e. you have attempted to solve
the entire problem immediately, instead of doing iterations.
