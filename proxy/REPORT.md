## Grades

### Following TDD principles

B

I think this is a good attempt. There were a few instances where code has been verbosely copied from hints I
gave which doesn't show much foresight into how it would have evolved

Overall a good effort, I would try do some more refactoring at the appropriate stages to remove extra
redundant code though

### Pass Rate

A

All tests passed

### White box analysis

C

Quite a bit of linting is not great

There is a lot of redundant code

### Miscellaneous Criteria

A

No real great blockers - Didn't want to give you double jeopardy

### Overall Grade

B

Very good attempt, showing some of the evolution you have made

In order to get up to the A grade focus more now on making sure other people can read / understand your code
easier and focus on the stylistic little tweaks
