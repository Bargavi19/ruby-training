  * Did you do red-green-refactor?
* Pass Rate - **20%**
  * Sequentially did you pass each spec file?
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
* White box analysis - **50%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)
  * Have you removed **all** redundant code
* Miscellaneous Criteria - **10%**
  * Git commit history (Easy to understand / follow)

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

A

Pretty much done as expected. I think there was some slight improvements to be made for committing, but
I have marked those down elsewhere

### Pass Rate

A

All passing

### White box analysis

B

You have removed all redundant code (You never added any), however ...

When using complex code, you should try make the complex part call more simpler parts

You have a metaprogram calling a conditional, based on an in-line statement, this is 3 areas of complexity
that could be reduced to one quite easily.

### Miscellaneous Criteria

B

Some commit messages aren't great

### Overall Grade

B

Very good attempt for a complex topic
