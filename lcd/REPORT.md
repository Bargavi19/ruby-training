## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles - **35%**
  * Are you following TDD principles?
  * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
  * Did you iterate on your work?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor for the suggested steps provided in the README?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor once it came to the stretch goals?
* Pass Rate - **15%**
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
  * Did you pass the `lcd_numbers_spec.rb` in its entirety?
  * Did you pass all tests?
* White box analysis - **45%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)
  * Have you removed **all** redundant code
* Miscellaneous Criteria - **5%**
  * Git commit history (Easy to understand / follow)

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

A

Followed the principles rather well. Was an apt amount of commits and you are started to use the declarative
style of language, which is what you need to aim for (X was done, I did Y)

Your grade was borderline A/B because whilst you are using the correct tone/tense, you are still ommitting some
information. It feels as though at times you are limiting yourself a la Twitter. If you need to write a long
commit message do so (Remember to keep the first line brief!)

### Pass Rate

B

All of your tests pass apart from ones that use the height modifier (Which was the final and hardest part)

### White box analysis

C

There is a marked improvement, but also this exercise was a noticeable step up, which I feel you didn't really
hit the heights you were needing to

Some of your linting / style has been improved, but then where you're using new items you are still making quite
a few mistakes

In terms of trying to translate your code, this was the biggest hurdle. It felt very un-ruby like, and other
than yourself, anyone would struggle immensely to try and understand what some of your methods / lines of code
are doing both deliberately and accidentally

If you are going to use incidental / accidental code that works, you need to try articulate either through
method names / localised names, or provide some sort of translation guide / key / legend. This (once provided),
will then see this grade up to a B without any issues

### Miscellaneous Criteria

A

No concerns here, but make sure (Just double check), your commit messages are accurate.

### Overall Grade

B

The biggest aim now for you needs to be style over substance. You are finding most of the problems soluble,
and as such are starting to cover all of the edge cases / use cases. So now you need to start thinking more
in terms of collaboration. You will soon be working **collaboratively** in a team, and other people will be
reading your code on a daily basis and refactoring it / trying to understand it.
